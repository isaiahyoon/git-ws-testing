1. Make repo
2. Add file
3. Ask git to take a snapshot


First person:
    1. Edit file
    2. git status
    3. git add .
    4. git status
    5. git commit -m "message"
    6. git push

After that's done, other person:
    git pull
    Check to see that the change is still there

Both people:
    - make a change to test.py
    => lesson: github only takes the first push to prevent overlap!
    

git log (to find the ID)
git revert THE_ID (to revert)
    (brings up vim)
    - :q
        do the revert but it won't commit
    - :wq
        do the revert 
git log (to show the history)

git status
git diff (shows changes)
